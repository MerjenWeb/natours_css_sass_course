	// This shouldn't be in pixels as we overwrite the browser settings that the user can manually change in the settings. For example, when people have bad eyesight, they increase the default font-size of their browser. If we set the font to 10px, then we remove the ability for these people to see our website properly, because they won't be able to change the default font-size. They can CHANGE it, but our font-size WON'T be affected by that. It will always be 10px, no matter what the user has as the default size.
